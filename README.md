## Build SnapQL locally

I will eventually ship some precompiled binaries, but that takes some setup. In the meantime, follow these steps to build a local copy:

### Quick Start (using Makefile)

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd snap-ql
make install-global  # Installs deps, builds for your platform, and adds to PATH
```

Now you can run `snap-ql` from anywhere in your terminal!

### Manual Build Steps

- clone the repo
- run `npm install` (or `make install`)
- if you're on MacOS, you will need to have XCode installed
- run `npm run build:mac` or `npm run build:win` depending on your platform (or `make dist-mac`/`make dist-win`)
- install the binary located in `./dist`

### Makefile Commands

- `make help` - Show all available commands
- `make dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `make install-global` - Build and install to PATH in one step
- `make link` / `make unlink` - Add/remove from PATH (after building)
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
