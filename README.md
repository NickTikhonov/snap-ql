### Build SnapQL locally
I will eventually ship some precompiled binaries, but that takes some setup. In the meantime, follow these steps to build a local copy:

* clone the repo
* run `npm install`
* if you're on MacOS, you will need to have XCode installed
* run `npm build:mac` or `npm build:win` depending on your platform
* install the binary located in `./dist`
